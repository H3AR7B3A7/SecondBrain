# “Soft skills”

Soft skills and tech skills are complementary. Here too it's important to realize that this is _not_ a checklist. The goal is not to tick boxes to see if someone fits in a specific column.

The approach is slightly different though: items listed as “should-have” for a Starter, will become “must-haves” for someone more experienced.

Here too, progression is not linear! It will take a lot longer to grow from “Expert” to “Guru” than it does to move from “Starter” to “Professional”.

## Developers

For developers, people who are starters or professionals are more focused on themselves. Experts focus on their own team, while a guru's focus is broader than their team or area.

Note: you can click on some items to see a bit more detail what they mean exactly.
