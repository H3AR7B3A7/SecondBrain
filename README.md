# Second Brain
If you want the full experience of my second brain, you will need to download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and open the project folder as a vault.

I am migrating all of my notes to this vault, because I love using this application to:
- Gain oversight
- Sync between devices
- Share knowledge

This is a work in perpetual progress. Feel free to poke around, correct or complete any of the topics.
