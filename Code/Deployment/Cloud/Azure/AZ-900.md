# Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

_Entry level cloud certification for [[Microsoft]] Azure._

[Official link]([Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals - Certifications | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-900/))

As a candidate for this exam, youâ€™re a technology professional who wants to demonstrate foundational knowledge of cloud concepts in general and Microsoft Azure in particular. This exam is a common starting point in a journey towards a career in Azure.

You can describe Azure architectural components and Azure services, such as:

- Compute
- Networking
- Storage

You can also describe features and tools to secure, govern, and administer Azure.

You should have skills and experience working with an area of IT, such as:

- Infrastructure management
- Database management
- Software development

## Content

- Understanding the basics of cloud computing
- Exploring the benefits of using cloud services
- Discovering the core services including computing networking storage and databases
- Understanding identity, Security and Governance of Cloud e.g., Entra ID (Azure ID)
- Understanding how pricing works in Azure including subscriptions and cost management tools
- Learning about the tools available for managing Azure resources e.g., Azure Portal

## Cloud Computing

_Using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer._

- Dedicated server
  One physical machine dedicated to a single business. Runs a single web-app/site. (Very Expensive, High Maintenance, High Security)
- Virtual Private Server (VPS)
  One physical machine dedicated to a single business. The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines. Runs multiple web-apps/sites. (Better Utilization and Isolation of Resources)
- Shared hosting
  One physical machine, shared by hundreds of businesses. Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources. (Very Cheap, Limited functionality, Poor Isolation)
- Cloud Hosting
  Multiple physical machines that act as one system. The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services. (Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-Effective, High Configurability)


## Common Cloud Services

_A cloud provider can have 100s of cloud services, The most common types of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):_

- Compute
- Storage
- Networking
- Databases

## Azure

_Bright blue color of the cloudless sky._

Azure is a Cloud service provider (CSP).

## Benefits

- Cost-effective
  You pay for what you consume, no upfront cost. Pay as you go (PAYG) thousands of customers sharing the cost of the resources
- Global
  Launch workloads anywhere in the world, Just choose a region
- Secure
  Cloud provider takes care of physical security. Cloud services aresecure by default or you have the ability to configure access down to granular level.
- Reliable
  Data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication, and fault tolerance
- Scalable
  Increase or decrease resources and services based on demand
- Elastic
  Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand
- Current
  The underlying hardware and managed software is patched, upgraded and replaced by the cloud provider without interruption

## Types of Cloud Computing

- Software as a Service (Saas) for customers
  A product that is run and managed by the service provider. (Gmail, Salesforce, Office 365, ...)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) for developers
  Focus on the deployment and management of your apps. (Heroku, Google app engine, ...)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for admins
  The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space. (Microsoft [[Azure]], [[AWS]], [[Oracle Cloud]], ...)
  
## Responsibilities

## Deployment Models

- Public Cloud
  _Aka Cloud Native, Everything is built on the Cloud Provider._
- Private Cloud
  _Aka On-Premise, Everything is built on company's datacenters_
  The cloud could be OpenStack
- Hybrid
  Using both On-Premise and a Cloud Service Provider
