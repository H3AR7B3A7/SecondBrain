# Agile Project Management  
Project management has only been around since half the twentieth century.   
Winston Royce wrote "Managing the development of Large Software Systems" in the 1970s,  
which described the phases in the 'waterfall methodology' as it was coined later.  
  
This methodology was the most common project management approach until it was surpassed  
by improved approaches based on agile techniques around 2008.  
  
Traditional projects (if successful at all) often suffer from scope bloat.  
Studies show that 64% of requested features are rarely or never used.  
  
Agile techniques are simply a codification of common sense of which seeds date back to  
Walter Sherwart's Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA).  
In 1986, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka published an article "New Product Development Game"  
describing aa rapid, flexible development strategy to meet fast-paced product demand.  
This article first paired the word '[[Scrum]]' with product development, which became one of the most  
popular agile project management frameworks.  
  
In 2001 the **'Agile Manifesto'** was created, a statement of values for successful software development.  
  
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
- **Responding to change** over following a plan  
  
*While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.*  
  
Empirical control requirements:  
- Unfettered transparency  
- Frequent inspections  
- Immediate adaptations  
  
*Working in **sprints** (smaller segments of the overall project) allows for this frequent inspection and adaptation.*  
  
**Strengths of Agile Project Management**:  
- Project success rate  
- Scope creep  
- Immediate adaptation based on frequent inspection  
  - Progress  
  - Customer satisfaction  
  
### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
  
The unique contributions of many individuals can be very powerful.  
Where a simple conversation can be clear and efficient, a lot of effort is needed to make  
processes and managed/controlled communication unambiguous.  
One process doesn't fit all teams and limits involvement of individuals.  
Working without individual interactions is overall less Agile.  
  
### Working software over comprehensive documentation  
  
Supporting development:  
- Requirements  
- Product technical specifications  
  
*This documentation should cover only 'just enough' information to be practical and efficient.*  
  
Supporting management:  
- Project schedule  
- Weekly status reports  
- Project communication plan  
  
*While helping management, these do not add value to development.*  
  
### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
  
There should be an ongoing good and clear communication with the customer.  
  
Traditionally:  
- Start of project  
- When scope changes  
- End of project  
  
Communication purely for negotiation discourages potentially valuable input from the customer.  
  
You can't know less about a project than at the start,  
so locking down project details at this point is hard due to a lack of information.  
  
### Responding to change over following a plan  
  
Frequently adapting to changing expectations will keep the project relevant and also avoids high costs  
from making changes in a later stage of product maturity.  
  
  
## Agile Principles  
  
The 12 Agile principles:  
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantages.  
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.  
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.  
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them an environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.  
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.  
- Working software is the primary measure of success.  
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances Agility.  
- Simplicity - the art of maximizing the work not done - is essential.  
- The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.  
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.  
  
Additional 3 'platinum' principles:  
- Resist formality  
  - Reduce organizational hierarchy, by eliminating titles  
  - Avoiding aesthetic investments like elaborate PowerPoint presentation and meeting minute forms  
  - Educating stakeholders on the cost of such displays  
- Think and act as a team  
  - Develop in pairs and switch partners often  
  - Uniform product development title  
  - Report at the project team level only  
  - Replace individual performance metrics with project team performance metrics  
- Visualize rather than write  
  - Stock on whiteboards, poster paper and drawing utilities  
  - Using models instead of text to communicate concepts  
  - Reporting project status through charts, graphs and dashboards  
    
  
## Agile vs Historical Approaches  
  
*In Agile development cost and schedules are fixed. It is the scope that is variable.*  
  
![[WaterfallVsAgile.png]]
  
### Agile Project Team  
- Developers  
- Testers  
- Designers  
- Project stakeholders  
- Product owner  
- Agile coach  
- Scrum master  
  
The **product owner** is a project team member who is an expert on the product and the customer's business needs.  
They prioritize product requirements and is available to provide daily clarifications and final acceptance to the development team.  
  
The **Scrum master** acts as a buffer between the development team and distractions that slow down development effort.  
They ensure that scrum is played properly and continuously improves the team's environment.  
  
The **Agile coach** provides expertise on agile processes and facilitate consensus building and stakeholder communication.  
Often this person is external to the projects department, offering an outsiders point of view.  
  
### Sprints  
  
Working in small **sprints** and completing functionality by priority ensures the project will add value for the customer.  
While some features might not yet be implemented, the product will always have useful functionality even halfway the production process.  
Historical approaches often require the project to be finished before adding any value to the customer and at this point   
making any changes would be harder and more expensive.  
  
![[WaterfallVsAgile2.png]]  
  
*Working in sprints provides areas of project stability, while also allowing for regular change.*  
  
### Reducing Non-Productive Tasks  
  
- In traditional projects **meetings** often take up a lot of time from developers, allowing for little time for development.  
  Agile projects should require only little formal meetings. They are focussed, short and handle a specific topic.  
  The Agile coach should try to prevent disruptions, which include non-agile meetings.  
  The project status is usually visually available to the entire organization, removing the need for status meetings.  
  
- Asking questions through **mail** is slow and inefficient. Face-to-face communication is faster and more concise.  
  
- Preparing a *presentation* (with slides etc.) takes up a lot of time. A simple demonstration of the product fulfilling  
  required functionality is both faster and more representable.  
  
- Documentation is only useful when it adds value to the project. Our code and automated tests already document a lot of the  
  development decisions that were made. Pictures & charts are usually more understandable than words, even for reporting to management.  
  
### Improved Team Performance  
  
- Environmental and organizational support for the team  
  - Collocation of team with product owner, physically close to customer  
  - Eliminating confusion  
  - Removal of impediments  
- Focus on the project  
  - One project that gets all the focus  
  - Availability of team members  
  - Small independent units of functionality  
  - No distractions = more productivity  
- Continuous improvement  
  - Each iteration is a fresh start  
  - Quick incorporation of changes  
  - A retrospective allows identifying and planning improvements  
  - Entire team reviews aspects that need improvement  
  - Lessons learned are taken to next sprint  
- Tighter project control  
  - Constant flow of information  
  - Daily prioritization  
  - Working functionality each sprint  
  - No administrative cost to changes in 'next' sprint  
  - Feature adequacy check at each sprint makes termination easy  
  
*Agile development is not only faster, but allows for early detection of failure.  
Providing opportunity to fix problems early and reduce the costs to do so.*  
  
### Return On Investment (ROI)  
  
- Functionality is delivered to the marketplace earlier  
- Product quality is higher  
- Revenue opportunity can be accelerated  
- Projects can self-fund  
  
### Strategies Reducing Wasted Time  
  
- Just-in-time elaboration  
- Customer and stakeholder participation  
- A bias for face-to-face conversation  
- Built-in exploitation of change  
- Emphasis on the evidence of working functionality  
  
### Development Team Benefits  
  
- A clear definition of success  
- The power and respect to self-organize  
- Customer feedback they need to provide value  
- Protection from disruptions  
- A humane, sustainable pace of work  
- A culture of learning that support both personal development and project improvement  
- A structure that minimizes non-development time  
  
  
## Agile Practices  
  
Different approaches:  
- Lean (Kanban)  
- Scrum  
- Extreme programming  
- ...  
  
### Lean  
  
*Methodology with roots in manufacturing processes as implemented by Toyota.*  
  
Principles:  
- Eliminate waste  
- Amplify learning  
- Deliver as late as possible (allowing for late adaptation)  
- Deliver as fast as possible  
- Empower the team  
- Build quality in (correcting defects when they happen)  
- See the whole (solving problems, not symptoms)  
  
### Kanban  
  
*Kanban (Japanese for 'visual signal') is a method for removing waste to improve flow and throughput in a system.*  
  
Practices:  
- Visualize (to help identify waste)  
- Limit work in progress  
- Manage flow  
- Make process policies explicit  
- Implement feedback loops  
- Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally  
  
![[Kanban.png]]
  
### Scrum  
  
*Scrum is an iterative approach with the 'sprint' at its core.*  
  
- Daily scrum meeting reviewing yesterday's work and planning for today's  
- Constant inspections to assess the progress towards the sprint goal  
- A retrospective at the end of a sprint to assess performance  
  
![[Scrum.png]]
  
Artifacts:  
- Product backlog  
- Sprint backlog  
- Product increment  
  
Events:  
- Sprint planning  
- Daily scrum  
- Sprint  
- Sprint review  
- Sprint retrospective  
  
### Extreme Programming  
  
Principles:  
- Coding is the core activity  
- Lots of testing  
- Direct communication between programmer and customer  
- Complex systems require some level of overall design, beyond any specific function  
  
Practices:  
- **Planning Game**    
No disconnect between business and technical people  
- **Whole Team**    
Customer is collocated with the development team  
- **Coding Standards**    
Standard code identifiers and naming conventions  
- **System Metaphor**    
Use of an implied comparison, a simple story  
- **Collective Code Ownership**    
Anyone can modify/improve any code  
- **Sustainable Pace**    
Avoid mistakes by avoiding working more than 40h / week  
- **Pair Programming**    
Strategic driver and tactical navigator pairs  
- **Design Improvement**    
Continuously refactor  
- **Simple Design**    
Keep the cost of changes low  
- **TDD**    
Red-Green-Clean  
- **Continuous Integration**    
Integrate code timely and avoid compounding problems  
- **Small Releases**    
Release value to customer often, avoiding extensive regression and integration efforts  
  
![[ExtremeProgramming.png]]
  
### Additional Powerful Tools  
  
- **Product Vision Statement**    
Gives direction for outer boundary of the project  
- **Product Roadmap**    
Required features for project vision  
- **Velocity**    
Tool to predict delivery of functionality  
- **Release Planning**    
Mid-range functionality goals/releases  
- **User Stories**  
 Requirements through end-user's point of view, clarifying business value  
- **Relative Estimation**    
Using relative complexity and effort rather than absolute measures  
- **Swarming**    
Cross-functional teams working together on a requirement  
  
  
## The Environment  
  
Why collocating the team is important:  
- Face-to-face communication  
- Scrum meetings standing up, to keep them brief and on topic  
- Using low-tech tools for communication  
- Getting real-time clarifications from scrum team members  
- Being aware of what others are working on  
- Asking for help with tasks  
- Supporting others with their tasks  
  
### Dedicated Project / Scrum Room  
  
- Central collaboration area or table  
- Whiteboards and bulletin boards  
- Open workspaces (around the edges)  
- Remove distractions  
- Mobile furniture (desks, laptops, whiteboards, ...)  
  
*Avoid cubical arrangements, or be creative to create a scrum room out of a couple of them.*  
  
### Common Distractions  
  
- Multiple projects  
- Multitasking  
- Over-supervising  
- Outside influence  
- Management  
  
### In Absence of Collocation  
  
- Videoconferences  
- Instant messaging  
- Web-based desktop sharing  
- Collaborating websites  
  
### Tools  
  
*Tools should solve a specific problem and push forward with the work.  
They should be as simple and straight forward as possible and not feel like an additional layer of complexity.  
Needs for these tools will emerge naturally from the scrum team.*  
  
  
## Behaviour  
  
*The product owner, development team and scrum master together make up the scrum team.  
Each role is a peer to the others - no one is the boss of anyone on the team.*  
  
![[ProjectTeam.png]]
  
### Product Owner  
  
*The product owner takes on a great responsibility during the project. Although the product sponsor  
funds and owns the budget, the product owner manages how the budget is spent.*

  - Willingly contributes to areas outside his or her mastery  
  - Enjoys learning new skills  
  - Enthusiastically shares knowledge  
- Multi-skilled (contribute, learn and teach)  
- Dedicated to one project  
- Collocated  
  
### Scrum Master  
  
*Don't underestimate the value of a scrum master with clout. Clout is not the same thing as authority.  
It is earned through: expertise, longevity, charisma and associations.*  
  
What makes a good scrum master:  
- Acts as a process coach, helps to organise and follow scrum values  
  - Is an expert on scrum processes  
  - Is passionate about agile techniques  
- Helps remove project impediments  
  - Has organizational clout and can resolve problems quickly  
  - Is articulate, diplomatic and professional

  - Looks at the needs of the project as a whole  
  - Avoids cliques and helps break down group silo's  
- Facilitates consensus building within the scrum team  
  - Understands techniques to help groups reach agreements  
- Protects the scrum team from organizational distractions  
  - Doesn't feel the need to be in charge  
  - Ensures everyone has the information they need  
  - Truly desires to help the scrum team  
  
### Stakeholders  
  
Can include:  
- Customer  
- Infrastructure architects / system administrators  
- Legal department / account managers / salespeople / marketing experts / customer service representatives  
- Other product or subject-matter experts

  - Trusting the ability to make good decisions  
  
  
## Defining Product Vision and Roadmap  
  
*Agile projects involve planning upfront and throughout the entire project.*  
  
![[RoadmapToValue.png]]
  
### Progressive Elaboration  
  
Planning only as much as you need to:   
- Widely and holistically at first  
- More detailed [[Analysis]] only just-in-time  
  - Inspect  
  - Adapt  
  
### The Product Vision Statement  
  
Four steps:  
- Develop the product objective  
- Create a draft vision statement  
- Validate the vision statement with product and project stakeholders and revise it based on feedback  
- Finalize the vision statement  
  
![[GeoffreyMooreTemplate.png]]
  
### The Product Roadmap  
  
Five steps:  
- Identify stakeholders  
- Establish product requirements and add them to the roadmap  
- Arrange the product requirements based on values  
- Estimate the development effort at a high-level and prioritize the product requirements  
- Determine high-level time frames for releasing groups of functionality to the customer  
  
  
### The Product Backlog  
  
Including:  
- A description of each requirement  
- The order of requirements based on priority  
- The effort estimates  
- The type of backlog item  
- A status  
  
  
## Planning Releases and Sprints  
  
*A clear and effective format for defining product requirements is the user story.*  
  
### User Story  
  
Includes:  
- Title  
- "As a..." (type of user)  
- "I want to..." (desired action)  
- "So that..." (reason or achieved benefit)  
- "When I..." (action taken) (desired behaviour)  
  
Also:  
- ID  
- Value and effort estimate  
- Creator  
  
Knowing the end users and the stakeholders intentions are key to creating these user stories.  
To better connect with the end-user we create personas representing different potential customers.  
  
**Decomposing User Stories**:  
- Theme  
  - Features  
    - Epic user stories  
      - User stories  
  
**The INVEST approach to user stories**:  
- Independent  
- Negotiable  
- Valuable  
- Estimable  
- Small  
- Testable  
  
### Estimation Poker  
  
*A popular way of estimating user stories is by playing estimation poker.*  
  
![[EstimationPoker.png]]
  
- Each member of the development team gets a deck.  
- A reference user story representing a '5' is agreed upon.  
- A high priority user story is selected  
- All members select their relative estimation using the deck  
- All cards are presented simultaneously  
- Differences in estimation are discussed  
- This repeats for the remaining user stories  
  
*Anything bigger than an 8 or 13 should not be allowed in a sprint and needs to be split up.*  
  
### Affinity Estimating  
  
Facing a lot of user stories a faster approach might be preferred, by grouping up user stories by size.  
  
Groups:  
- Extra-small (1)  
- Small (2)  
- Medium (3)  
- Large (5)  
- Extra-large (8)  
- Epic and too large for a sprint (13+)  
- Needs clarification before estimating  
  
Placing a user story in a group should take no longer than 60s.  
30min/ 100 user stories to adjust groups can help straighten things out.  
  
### Release Planning  
  
*A release is a group of usable product features that you deploy to the market.*  
  
- Establish the release goal  
- Identify a target release date  
- Review the product backlog and product roadmap to determine the highest-priority user stories supporting the release goal (the minimum marketable features)  
- Refine the user stories in the release goal  
- Estimate the number of sprints needed, based on the scrum team's velocity  
- Identify work necessary to release that can't be completed within a sprint, if necessary, and determine how long it should be  
  
Some scrum teams release functionality for customer use with every sprint, or every day depending on circumstances.  
  
### Sprint Planning  
  
- Sprint planning at the beginning of the sprint  
  - Usually on monday  
  - Duration of +-2hours / length of sprint in weeks  
- Daily scrum meetings  
- Development time (the bulk of the sprint)  
- A sprint review and retrospective  
  
### Sprint Backlog  
  
*The sprint backlog is the list of user stories associated with the current sprint and related tasks.*  
  
The sprint backlog usually contains a little more detail than the project backlog that was added during the sprint plannings.  
  
A **burndown chart** shows the status of the work the development team has completed.  
  
  
## Working Throughout The Day  
  
*On Agile projects, you make plans throughout the entire project and on a daily basis.*  
  
### Daily Scrum Meeting  
  
Each development team member:  
- "Yesterday, I completed..." (completed items)  
- "Today, I'm going to take on..." (task)  
- "My impediments are..."  
  
The scrum master:  
- "Yesterday, I resolved to..." (completed impediments)  
- "Today, I'm going to work on removing..." (impediment)  
- "The impediments I'm going to escalate are..." (impediments needing assistance)  
  
Guidelines:  
- Anyone may attend, but only the development team, the scrum master, and the product owner may talk  
- The focus is on immediate priorities  
- They are for coordination, not problem-solving  
  - Issues go on a whiteboard  
  - An after-party with the people involved can address them when the meeting is over  
- Peer-to-peer coordination, not status reports  
- Starts on time  
- Usually standing up  
    
### Tracking progress  
  
*Sprint backlog and burndown chart should be available for everyone.*  
  
**Burndown Chart**:  
- The outstanding work (in hours) on the first vertical axis  
- Time in days on the horizontal axis  
- Story points remaining on a second vertical axis  
  
### The Task Board  
  
Minimum number of columns:  
- To Do  
- In Progress  
- Accept  
- Done  
  
Items 'In Progress' should be kept to a minimum at all times.    
Only the product owner can move user stories to 'Done'  
  
### Roles  
  
Members of the development team:  
- Select the tasks of the highest need and complete them as quickly as possible  
- Request clarification from the product owner when unclear about a user story  
- Collaborate with other development team members  
  - Design the approach to a specific user story  
  - Seek help when needed  
  - Provide help when a team member needs it  
- Conduct peer reviews  
- Take on tasks beyond your normal role as the sprint demands  
- Fully develop functionality as agreed to in the definition of done  
- Report on progress daily  
- Alert the scrum master to any roadblocks  
- Achieve the sprint goal, committed to during sprint planning  
  
The product owner:  
- Make investments required to keep development speed high  
- Prioritize product functionality  
- Represent the product stakeholders to the team  
- Report on cost and schedule to stakeholders  
- Elaborate on user stories  
- Provide immediate clarification and decisions  
- Remove business impediments  
- Review completed functionality and provide feedback  
- Add new user stories to the backlog, ensuring they support product vision and sprint/release goals  
- Elaborate user stories in readiness for the next sprint meeting  
  
The Scrum master:  
- Uphold Agile values, coaching the product owner, team and organization  
- Shield the development team from external distractions  
- Remove roadblocks  
  - Tactically for immediate problems  
  - Strategically for potential long-term issues  
- Facilitate concensus building  
- Build relationships to foster close cooperation with people working with the scrum team  
  
### Creating Shippable Functionality  
  
Development team and product owner:  
- Elaborating  
- Developing  
  - Pairing up  
  - Following agreed-upon design standards  
  - Start with automated test  
  - Adding nice-to-have features to backlog  
  - Integrate changes one at a time  
- Verifying  
  - Automated testing  
    - Unit  
    - System  
    - Static  
  - Peer reviews  
  - Product owner reviews  
  
### Roadblocks  
  
Some examples:  
- Tactical  
  - A manager trying to pull away a team member to work on something else  
  - The development team needing additional hardware or software to facilitate progress  
  - A team member who doesn't understand a user story in absence of the product owner  
- Strategical  
  - An overall resistance to Agile techniques, especially when a company established and maintained prior processes at significant cost  
  - Managers not in touch with work on the ground, methodologies are ever progressing  
  - External departments not familiar with scrum needs and the pace of development when using Agile techniques  
  - An organization enforcing policies that don't make sense for Agile projects  
    - Centralized tools  
    - Budget restrictions  
    - Standardized processes that don't align  
  
### Days End  
  
- Reporting task progress  
- Updating sprint backlog (with amount of work remaining)  
- Product owner updates task board  
- The scrum master reviews the sprint backlog  
  
  
## Showcasing, Inspecting and Adapting  
  
### The Spring Review  
  
A meeting to review and demonstrate the developed functionality.   
  
*Preparing for a sprint review meeting should only take a few minutes.  
If your sprint review is overly showy, you should ask yourself if you're covering up for not spending enough time developing.*  
  
Demonstrated code should be:  
- Developed  
- Tested  
- Integrated  
- Documented  
  
The demo provides the 3d stage of feedback:  
- Peer reviews  
- From product owner  
- **From stakeholders**  
- From customers  
  
The review meetIng:  
- No PowerPoint  
- For entire scrum team  
- Anyone interested may attend  
- Product owner introduces release goal  
- The development team demonstrates  
- The equipment used should mirror the target hardware if possible  
- Stakeholders ask questions and give feedback  
- No non-disclosed rigged functionality  
- The product owner can lead a discussion on what is coming next  
  
New user stories can emerge with either new functionality or changes to existing functionality.  
  
### The Retrospective  
  
A meeting in which the product owner, the development team, and the scrum master discuss how the sprint went  
and what they can do to improve it.  
  
Agile approaches reveals problems in a project. We need to pay attention to what gets exposed and not ignore it.  
  
Primary questions:  
- "What went well?"  
- "What would we lik0e to change?"  
- "How can we implement that change?"  
  
Secondary:  
- Results: Planned work vs. completed  
- People: Team composition and alignment  
- Relations: Communication, elaboration and pairs  
- Processes: Support, development and peer reviews  
- Tools: Effectivity  
- Productivity: Improvements  
  
Format:  
- Set the stage: Goals, Focus on specific areas  
- Gather data: Whiteboard  
- Generate insights: Ideas on improvements  
- Decide what to do: Agree on specific actions  
- Close the retrospective  
  
  
## preparing For Release  
  
### The Release Sprint  
  
The release sprint only contains things needed to move working functionality to the marketplace.  
  
- Creating user documentation for the most recent version of the product  
- Performance / load / security testing  
- Integration with enterprise-wide systems  
- Organizational or regulatory procedures  
- Release notes  
- Deployment package to move to production  
- Deployment to production environment  
  
### Preparing for Operational Support  
  
Supporting the product involves:  
- Responding to customer inquiries  
- Maintaining the system in a production environment  
- Enhancing existing functionality to fill minor gaps  
  
*Separating support and development helps focus on continuous innovation.  
Roughly a third of the team could be assigned maintenance, while the others stay on development.  
The developers can rotate one at a time every release bringing knowledge of new developments to maintenance.*  
  
### The Organization  
  
The release sprint backlog can also contain activities for different departments in the organization  
in preparation for a release. Therefore, the right people should be involved.  
  
### The Marketplace  
  
*Preparing customers is a key part to product success.*  
  
Different teams that may help:  
- Marketing support  
- Customer support  
- Marketing Materials  
- Support channels  
  
Think about what the persona's we created would need to know about current backlog.  
  
## Managing Scope and Procurement  
  
Product scope: All the required features  
Project scope: All the work involved in creating a product  
  
An agile scope management allows for scope changes.  
- The product owner ensures that the whole project team understands the existing scope  
- The product owner determines the value and priority of new requirements  
- The development team creates product requirements in order of priority  
  
### Managing Scope Changes  
  
Considerations:  
- Requirement of the change  
  - Support of product vision  
  - Support of current release goal  
  - Support of current sprint goal  
- Effort for the requirement  
- Priority of requirement  
  
### Procurement  
  
*On agile projects procurement starts when the development team decides it needs a tool,  
or the services of a third party to create the product.*  
  
Needs for procurement can arise at different stages of the project.  
From investigating the need to looking for concrete procurements:  
- Product vision stage  
- Product roadmap stage  
- Release planning  
- Sprint planning  
- Daily scrum  
- Throughout the day  
- Sprint review meeting  
- Sprint retrospective  
  
Considerations:  
- Can the vendor work in an agile project environment  
- Can the vendor work on-site  
- Will the relation between vendor and scrum team likely be collaborative  
- Laws and regulations for choosing vendors  
  
*Ideally a vendor team get collocated, or some of their team members can join in for scrum meetings.  
They work on the same sprint schedule as the buyer's scrum team.*  
  
### Cost Approaches and Contracts  
  
Different structures:  
- Fixed-price project  
- Fixed-time project  
- Time-and-materials project  
- Not-to-exceed project  
  
Contract Content:  
- Description of the different parties  
- The budget  
- The cost approach and payment terms  
- A description of the work  
- Agile approaches the vendor may use  
  - Or a description of integration with the buyer's development team and sprint  
  
Organizational Considerations:  
- Company or organization size and experience  
- Company or organization type  
- Company or organization culture  
  
*The scrum master makes sure the procurement people understand why a contract mey need to  
accommodate changing requirements and iterations.  
He also makes sure the organisation follows agile practices and principles.*  
  
### Closing a Contract  
  
*The scrum master acknowledges to the vendor that the contract is closed.  
A sincere "thank you" can help maintain a good relation for future projects.*  
  
  
## Managing Time and Cost  
  
*The development speed is closely related to time and cost of a project.*  
  
### Agile Time Management  
  
*A big benefit of agile time management is that agile project teams can deliver projects much  
earlier than traditional project teams. The early delivery of functionality with high priority  
ensures working within time and budget constraints.*  
  
*Agile projects finish sooner because they start development sooner.*  
  
### Managing Agile Schedules  
  
Velocity is the tool for time management in agile projects. It allows the forecasting of how long  
the scrum team will take, and consequently the cost it will take to complete a certain number of requirements.  
  
Velocity is a post-sprint fact and should not be guessed or committed to.  
The sum of story points completed in last sprint is the team's velocity for that sprint.  
It should not be seen as a performance metric, but a planning tool. The velocity is team and project specific  
and can't help with comparing teams nor projects.  
  
The project velocity is an average of each sprint velocity divided by the number of sprints. It gains in accuracy every sprint.  
  
When we know the velocity, and the remaining number of story points, we can now estimate the project time line.  
  
*Usually the velocity is lowest at the start of the project during the first sprints.*  
  
How to increase velocity:  
- Avoid roadblocks  
- Remove roadblocks  
- Eliminate distractions  
- Solicit input from the team  
  
How to keep velocity accurate:  
- Consistent sprint length  
- Consistent work hours  
- Consistent number of team members  
  
*Requirements Darwinism forces out requirements of lesser importance and ensures completion of requirements with high priority.  
This way new requirements might have no effect on the project timeline.*  
  
*If the product owner and stakeholders decide all requirements are useful enough to include in the project, the end date might need to be extended.*  
  
*In larger projects, multiple scrum teams working in parallel may be able to complete a project in a shorter time frame.  
Working with multiple teams, it can be useful to divide the work into themes. They need to be sufficiently separated to allow team independence.*  
  
Tools:  
- The product roadmap: Offers a strategic look at the overall priorities and allows initial framing for bringing the product to market  
- The product backlog: Story points in backlog allow for estimations using the velocity  
- Release plan: Contains target release dates for minimal sets of marketable functionality  
- Sprint backlog: Contains estimations in hours and allows for calculation of velocity post-sprint  
  
### Cost Management  
  
*Agile development avoids hostage situations where project sponsors either pay more or get nothing.*  
  
Cost is mostly a direct expression of project time, and the cost of a team of full-time dedicated members.  
  
Initial budget:  
- Cost of scrum team  
- Cost of additional resources  
  - Hardware  
  - Software licenses  
  - Hosting  
  - Training  
  - Miscellaneous team expenses  
    - Office supplies  
    - Lunches  
    - Travel  
    - Tools  
  
*Separating one-time costs from sprint costs is recommended.*  
  
*Resources refer to inanimate objects, not people. They are referred to as team members, talent or just people.*  
  
**Self-funding**:    
Agile projects sometimes have the capability to be self-funding. If the product generates income,  
early releases can help fund the rest of your project.  
  
### Lowering Costs  
  
*Time being the primary factor in the cost of the project, there is a lot to gain from removing impediments for the development team.*  
  
*Another option to lower cost is by not completing lower-priority requirements.*  
  
### Deciding on Capital Redeployment  
  
Required insights:  
- Business value of the remaining requirements  
- The actual cost of the required work to complete backlog  
- The opportunity cost, or the value of working on the new project  
  
*Pausing a project can be expensive. Stopping and restarting it can take a lot of extra work.  
These costs should be considered before any decisions are made.*  
  
  
## Team Dynamics and Communication  
  
*The core reason agile teams are different from traditional teams are their team dynamics.*  
  
Characteristics:  
- Self-managing & Self-organizing  
- Servant-leader: Coaches, removes obstacles and prevents distractions  
- Team performance  
- Focus on one project  
- Cross-functional skills  
- Limited in size for good communication  
  
### Managing Team Dynamics  
  
*Each team member of the scrum team has the opportunity to lead informally, based on skills, ideas and initiative.*  
  
**Self-management** assumes that people are professional, motivated and dedicated enough to commit to a job and see it through.  
Working with a self-managing scrum team requires trust and respect within the team and the organization.  
Accountability is at the core of Agile projects. Self-management returns innovation and creativity to the development team.  
It creates better architectures, requirements and design because people are more engaged.  
  
A role in all management areas:  
- Scope  
- Procurement  
- Time  
- Cost  
- Team dynamics  
- Communication  
- Stakeholders interaction  
- Quality  
- Risk  
  
### The Servant-Leader  
  
*The scrum master serves as a servant leader. Servant-leadership is a concept that has been around since 1970.  
It was coined by Robert K. Greenleaf who founded the centre for applied ethics.*  
  
Characteristics:  
- Listening  
- Empathy  
- Healing  
- Awareness  
- Persuasion  
- Conceptualization  
- Foresight  
- Stewardship  
- Commitment to growth of people  
- Building community  
  
The servant-leader role has been more thoroughly described in 'The NEw One-Minute Manager' by K. Blanchard and S. Johnson.  
  
### Dedicated Team  
  
Benefits:  
- Focus on one project, no distractions  
- Fewer distractions, fewer mistakes  
- Knowing what you will work on stimulates engagement  
- More innovation  
- Higher satisfaction  
- Allows predictions using velocity  
  
### Cross-Functional Team  
  
*While each person has specialties, being cross-functional means that everyone on the team is willing to pitch in  
on different parts of the project, as much as they can.*  
  
*Working on different aspects of the same problem increases knowledge depth, and the ability to do a better job.*   
### Openness  
  
*Scrum team members working in the same physical location and being able to talk in person, instantly, is important to team dynamics.*  
  
Everyone should be able to:  
- Feel safe  
- Speak their mind positively  
- Challenge the status quo  
- Be open about challenges without being penalized  
- Request resources that will make a difference to the project  
- Make mistakes and learn from them  
- Suggest change and expect serious consideration  
- Respect fellow scrum team members  
- Be respected by other members of the scrum team  
  
*Some of the best product and process improvements come from novices asking 'silly' questions.*  
  
### Limited Size  
  
*An ideal team size is somewhere in between 3 and 9 team members.*  
  
More people tend to break into subgroups. While perfectly normal social behavior, it can disrupt the team's self-management.  
  
Not enough people might result in a team poor in skill variety.  
  
### Dislocated Teams  
  
*A lot of reasons might prevent collocation.*  
  
Models of distributed scrum teams:  
- Isolated scrums: Only code level integration through coding standards  
- Distributed scrum of scrums: A meeting of scrum masters to integrate on daily basis  
- Integrated scrums: Cross-functional including a scrum of scrums  
  
*Communicate, communicate, communicate...*  
  
Tips:  
- Use video conferencing technology  
- Arrange to meet in person in a central location if possible  
- Use an online collaboration tool  
- Include scrum team member pictures in all communication channels  
- Be cognizant of time zone differences  
- Be flexible because of time zone differences  
- When in doubt on a message, clarify through phone or video  
- Be aware of language and cultural differences  
- Discuss non-work related topics sometimes  
  
### Communication  
  
*You can communicate on agile projects through artifacts, meetings and informally.*  
  
![[CommunicationTypes.png]]
  
All the previously mentioned meetings are there to provide means and format for communication  
in a face-to-face environment and the artifacts for written communication.  
  
### Reporting Status and Progression  
  
**Status** is a measure of the features the scrum team has completed.  
Working functionality that meets the definition of done is the primary measure of progress.  
  
Progress of the sprint and project should be tracked daily and for that we use:  
- Task board  
- Sprint backlog  
- Product backlog  
- Release and sprint burn down charts  
- Sprint reviews  
  
*Stakeholders and especially sponsors have an invested interest in the progress and should be encouraged  
joining the sprint reviews as well as knowing where to find these artifacts.*  
  
## Managing Quality and Risk  
  
*Quality management on agile projects fundamentally reduces project risk.*  
  
All 12 Agile principles promote quality either directly or indirectly.  
  
Quality dynamics:  
- Testing is a daily part of each sprint  
  - Testing small parts of code is easier  
  - Fixing code recently worked on is easier  
  - Testing is assured and not forgotten about  
- Proactively encouraging good (quality) practices  
- Riskier features are added first, when sunk costs are low  
- Multiple quality feedback loops  
  - Peer review  
  - Product owner  
  - Stakeholders  
  - End-users  
  
Agile development teams have the primary responsibility for quality.  
  
Proactive good practices:  
- Emphasis on technical excellence and good design  
  - Freedom of self-management  
  - Organizational commitment to excellence  
- Incorporation of quality-specific development techniques into product creation  
  - TDD  
  - Pair programming  
  - Peer review  
  - Collective code ownership  
  - Continuous integration  
- Daily communication between development team and product owner  
  - A voice of business needs  
- Acceptance criteria built into user stories  
  - Clarity of criteria  
- Face-t-face communication and collocation  
  - Clarity of requirements, roadblocks and overall discussions  
- Sustainable development  
  - Good rhythm and enough sleep/life makes for better decisions  
- Regular inspection and adaption of work and behaviour  
  - Sprint review, retrospective and on daily basis  
  
### Develop and Test  
  
Steps:  
- Develop code and automated tests  
- Create an integrated code build at the end of the day  
- Schedule the automated testing software to test the newest build over night  
- Check results first thing in the morning  
- Fix any defects immediately  
  
Types of software testing:  
- Unit testing  
- Regression testing  
- User acceptance testing  
- Functional testing  
- Integration testing  
- Enterprise testing  
- Performance testing  
- Load testing  
- Smoke testing  
- Static testing  
  
### Risk  
  
*Risk refers to the factors that contribute to a project's success or failure.*  
  
Risk management is built into the artifacts and methodology used in Agile projects.  
  
![[ChaosResolutionByAgileVsWaterfall.png]]
  
Risk dynamics:  
- Catastrophic failure almost eliminated  
- Immediate gain in product value  
- Infeasibility discovered early on  
- Agile projects welcome change for product benefit  
- Time and cost estimated on actual performance  
- The product owner ensures a vision for the product  
- The product owner is an immediate source of information  
- The scrum master removes impediments on a daily basis  
  
![[DecliningRisk.png]]
  
### Inherent and Active Risk Management  
  
Inherent:  
- Definition of done: Ensures there is no confusion of expectations  
- Self-funding: Can mitigate the financial risks of a product  
- Failing fast: Minimizes the cost of failure  
  
*On top of that teams should still be aware of problems that can arise during a project.  
The use of the Agile artifacts should help identify, prioritize and respond to risk early.*  
  
## Agile Foundations  
  
*To successfully move from traditional project management to Agile processes, we must start with a good foundation.  
We need commitment, both from the organization and people as individuals.  
We need a good project team for a first Agile project, providing them an environment conducive to Agile approaches.  
We want to find the right training for your project team, and sustainably support the organization's Agile approach,µ  
so it can grow beyond the first project.*  
  
### Organizational Commitment  
  
- Engaging an experienced Agile expert  
- Investing in employee training (first team and all leaders)  
- Allowing abandonment of waterfall processes and documents  
- Ensuring dedicated team members  
- Encourage continuous increase of skills  
- Provide automated testing tools and integration framework  
- Logistically support collocation  
- Allowing for self-management  
- Allowing freedom for a healthy trial and error process  
- Revising employee performance to emphasize team performance  
- Encouragement and acknowledging success  
  
### Individual Commitment  
  
- Attending training and conferences, with willingness to learn Agile methodology  
- Being open to change  
- Not fall back on old processes  
- Acting as a peer coach for team members with less Agile experience  
- Allowing themselves to make mistakes and learn  
- Honest reflection on sprints and committing to improvements  
- Actively becoming multi-skilled  
- Letting go of ego and work as a team  
- Taking responsibility for success and failure as a team  
- Taking the initiative to be self-managing  
- Being active and present  
  
### Getting Commitment  
  
Things that can aid in getting commitment:  
- Agile Champion Senior-Manager  
- Example Agile solutions to existing problems  
- Highlighting overall benefits  
  - Happy customers  
  - Profit  
  - Defect-reduction  
  - Morale  
  
### Considerations  
  
Questions:  
- What are the organizational roadblocks?  
- How are you doing business today?  
- How do your teams work today, and what will need to shift?  
- What are the regulatory challenges?  
  
Concerns:  
- Agile approaches reveal that the organization needs to change  
- Project management leaders may misinterpret Agile techniques as insufficient  
- Moving from a leadership to a service model can be challenging  
  
### The Right Time  
  
*Organizationally, we can start the initiative to move to an Agile approach at any time.*  
  
Optimal times:  
- When we need to prove that Agile project management is necessary  
- When our challenge is doing accurate budgeting  
- When we start a new project  
- When we try to reach a new market or industry  
- When we have new leadership  
  
### Champion  
  
Characteristics:  
- Passionate about Agile and addressed issues  
- Decisive on company processes  
- Excitement inducing  
- Collaborative with project team  
- Skilled at picking project team members  
- Willing to remove unnecessary distractions  
  
### Team  
  
Characteristics:  
- Committed to organization success and support of Agile teams  
- Have a vision on roadmap to becoming Agile  
- Organized like a scrum team  
- Operate as scrum team (5 event, 3 artifacts)  
  
### Certifications  
  
There are many Agile certifications from different organization:  
- Scrum Alliance  
- The Project Management Institute  
- Scrum.org  
- International Consortium for Agile  
- University Programs  
- ...  
  
  
## Scaling  
  
*Scale only when required. Multiple teams don't automatically ensure higher quality and faster time to market.*  
  
### Challenges  
  
- **Project planning**    
Collaboration for large groups is different.  
- **Release planning**    
More specific planning of scope and timing is required.  
- **Decomposition**    
Breaking down larger requirements might need multiple teams.  
- **Sprint planning**    
Dependencies between scrum teams are a reality.  
- **Daily coordination**    
Daily collaboration is required.  
- **Sprint review**    
Double the reviews with stakeholders should be managed and accomplishments shared among teams.  
- **Sprint retrospective**    
Harder to identify and implement improvements across the program.  
- **Integration**    
All product increments need to be integrated.  
- **Architecture decisions**    
Maintaining self-organization and autonomy in architecture and standards needs consideration.  
  
### Vertical Slicing  
  
Multiple scrum teams work in synchronized sprints of the same length on a separate portion or module of the product.  
These modules are integrated by an integration scrum team that lags behind the development teams with one sprint.  
This can be done on multiple levels when needed, with each integration scrum team handling the developed  
functionality of the teams that feed into it.  
  
In the scrum of scrums for **product owners**, each gathers for 15 minutes with the integration team product owner.  
  
Addressed topics are:  
- Accepted and rejected business requirements  
- Requirements that should be accepted by next scrum  
- Impeded requirements that need help from other teams  
  
In the scrum of scrums for **developers**, one developer from each team joins the integration team's daily scrum.  
  
Addressed topics are:  
- Accomplishments since last time  
- Planned accomplishment for next meeting  
- Technical concerns in need of help  
- Technical direction decisions that need awareness to prevent issues  
  
In the scrum of scrums for **scrum masters**, each gathers for 15 minutes with the integration team scrum master.  
  
Addressed topics are:  
- Resolved team-level impediments  
- Newly identified impediments  
- Impediments needing help to resolve  
- Potential impediments that need awareness  
  
*When there are more than five scrum teams, a scrum of scums of scrums might be required.*  
  
### LeSS  
  
Large scale scrum is another way to scale scrum across massive projects.  
  
Differences:  
- One scum master for 1-3 teams  
- One product owner for up to 8 teams  
- Sprint planning requires at least 2 developers per scrum team and the product owner  
- Independent sprint planning and scrum meetings can be attended by members from other team  
- Sprint reviews are combined across all teams  
- An overall sprint retrospective in addition to individual ones  
  
### LeSS Huge  
  
*With LeSS Huge, a few thousand people could work on one project.*  
  
Differences:  
- Scrum teams are grouped around major areas of customer requirements  
- Each area has one area product owner  
- Each area has 4-8 scrum teams  
- One overall product coordinates with different area product owners  
- Requirement areas are added to the product backlog  
- Parallel sprint meetings per requirement area  
- Overall sprint reviews and retrospectives are required for continuous inspection and adaptation  
  
*Sprint reviews can be organized similar to a science fair, both for stakeholders and other scrum teams.*  
  
### Travelers  
  
The more versatile a development team, the fewer the bottlenecks. This it can be useful for specialist  
become travelers joining different scrum teams to coach and mentor in their area of expertise.  
  
### Nexus  
  
Reduction of inter-team dependencies is key to scaling success. Nexus is a scaling framework  
focussed on treating multiple teams as a single unit.  
  
![[NexusFramework.png]]
  
- One additional role  
  - Nexus integration team  
    - Product owner  
    - Scrum master  
    - Development team members (usually also team members from the nexus)  
- Three additional artifacts  
  - Nexus goal  
  - Nexus sprint backlog  
  - Integrated increment  
  
### SAFe  
  
Scaled Agile Framework is used to scale scrum and agile principles across multiple layers of an IT   
and software development organization.  
  
![[SAFe5.png]]
*[Click here](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) for an interactive version.  
  
SAFe has three configurations:  
- Portfolio  
- Large solution  
- Essential  
  - Program  
  - Team  
    
#### Portfolio Level  
  
*An enterprise or government containing different businesses/departments.*  
  
*Lean portfolio management* aligns strategy and execution through communicating strategic themes, value streams and budget allocation.  
  
A value stream is defined as a sequence of steps.  
  
Additional roles driving decisions:  
- **Epic owner**    
Epics are the largest and most long-term initiatives driving business value for the organization.  
- **Enterprise architect**    
Establishes common technical vision and drives a holistic approach to technology.  
  
#### Large Solution Level  
  
*For solutions that require more than 125 people.*  
  
The solution train coordinates multiple agile release trains.  
  
Additional roles:  
- Solution architect  
- Solution management  
- Solution train engineer  
  
#### Program Level  
  
*The Agile release trains.*  
  
Additional roles:  
- System architect  
- Product management  
- Release train engineer  
  
#### Team Level  
  
*The teams that make up an Agile release train.*  
  
They work in cadence with each other, and their backlogs align with program vision and backlog.
