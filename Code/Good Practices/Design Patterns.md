# Design Patterns
Design patterns:

-   Are reusable in multiple projects.
-   Provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
-   Capture the software engineering experiences.
-   Provide transparency to the design of an application.
-   Are well-proved and testified solutions since they have been built upon the knowledge and experience of expert software developers.
-   Don't guarantee an absolute solution to a problem. They provide clarity to the system architecture and the possibility of building a better system.

Design patterns can be divided in:

-   [[Creational Design Patterns]]
-   [[Structural Design Patterns]]
-   [[Behavioral Design Patterns]]
