# SOLID Principles
  
## Single responsibility  
  
A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.  
  
## Open/close Principle  
  
Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.  
  
## Liskov substitution Principle  
  
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.  
  
## Interface Segregation Principle  
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.  
  
## Dependency Inversion  
We should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
