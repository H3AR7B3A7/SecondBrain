## Spring Events

[[Spring]] application events allow us to throw and listen to specific application events that we can process as we wish. Events are meant for exchanging information between loosely coupled components. As there is no direct coupling between publishers and subscribers, it enables us to modify subscribers without affecting the publishers and vice-versa.
