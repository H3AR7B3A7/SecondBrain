# Protocol Buffers

[Official pages](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)

Protocol buffers are [[Google]]'s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.

**WARNING**: The protoc command added to this project works only for windows. For protoc to work on your operating system download the right version [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases). We can also use our build tool ([Maven](https://dzone.com/articles/compile-protocol-buffers-using-maven) / [Gradle](https://medium.com/@DivyaJaisawal/generate-java-code-from-proto-file-using-gradle-1fb9fe64e046)) to automate the code generation.
