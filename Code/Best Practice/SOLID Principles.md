# SOLID Principles

In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many [[Best Practice(s)]] principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin, first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.

## Single Responsibility

A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.  

## Open/close Principle

Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.  

## Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.  

## Interface Segregation Principle

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## Dependency Inversion

We should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
