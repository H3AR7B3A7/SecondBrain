# Project Managers  
It can be considered [[Best Practice(s)]] to use project managers. They help people to set up projects and dependencies with consistency and ease.

## Maven  
  
[[Maven]] is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build,  
dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process like ANT. But it is too much advanced than ANT.  
In short terms we can tell maven is a tool that can be used for building and managing any Java-based project.  
Maven makes the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and helps with the comprehension of any Java-based project.  
  
### Installation  
  
- [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) the binaries  
- Extract binary to a folder on the hard drive  
- Create a new environment variable **MAVEN_HOME** for the installation folder  
- Edit path with a new entry: **%MAVEN_HOME%\bin**  
  
## Gradle  
  
[[Gradle]] is a build automation tool for multi-language software development. It controls the development process in the  
tasks of compilation and packaging to testing, deployment, and publishing. Supported languages include  
Java (Kotlin, Groovy, Scala), C/C++, and JavaScript.  
  
### Installation  
  
- [Download](https://gradle.org/releases/) the binaries  
- Extract binary to a folder on the hard drive  
- Create a new environment variable **GRADLE_HOME** for the installation folder  
- Edit path with a new entry: **%GRADLE_HOME%\bin**  
  
[Gradle vs Maven](https://gradle.org/maven-vs-gradle/)  
  
## Ant  
  
[[Apache Ant]] is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes described in build files  
as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications.  
Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant can also be  
used effectively to build non Java applications, for instance C or C++ applications. More generally,  
Ant can be used to pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of targets and tasks.  
  
### Installation  
  
- [Download](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) the binaries  
- Extract binary to a folder on the hard drive  
- Create a new environment variable **ANT_HOME** for the installation folder  
- Edit path with a new entry: **%ANT_HOME%\bin**
