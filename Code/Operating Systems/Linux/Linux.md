# Linux
Linus Torvalds created his own kernel known as Linux. The kernel is the part of an OS that facilitates interactions between hardware and software.

At the time, many [[GNU]] 'pieces' were complete, but it lacked a kernel. Torvalds combined his kernel with the existing GNU components to create a full [[Unix]]-like operating system. It is considered [[Unix]]-like, because True-[[Unix]] was proprietary and Linux is open source.

Today there are nearly a thousand different Linux distributions (or distros) available:
- Fedora
- Debian
- Ubuntu
- Slackware
