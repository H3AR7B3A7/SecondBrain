# Kali
Kali Linux is a [[Debian]]-derived [[Linux]] distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.  
It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.  
  
It was developed by Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns of Offensive Security through the rewrite of BackTrack,  
their previous information security testing Linux distribution based on Knoppix.  
Originally, it was designed with a focus on kernel auditing, from which it got its name Kernel Auditing Linux.  
The name is sometimes incorrectly assumed to come from Kali the Hindu goddess. The third core developer,  
RaphaÃ«l Hertzog, joined them as a Debian expert.  
  
## Tools  
Kali Linux has around 600 pre-installed penetration-testing programs (tools), including:   
- **Armitage**: A graphical cyber-attack management tool  
- **Nmap**: A port scanner  
- **Wireshark**: A packet analyzer  
- **Metasploit**: A penetration testing framework, awarded as the best penetration testing software  
- **John the Ripper**: A password cracker  
- **Sqlmap**: An automatic SQL injection and database takeover tool  
- **Aircrack-ng**: A software suite for penetration-testing wireless LANs  
- **Burp suite** and **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security scanners  
- ...  
  
## GUI  
Kali Linux uses XFCE as desktop environment by default, but other options are available during the OS installation.  
  
## Terminal  
Kali Linux uses qTerminal by default, but other options are available during the OS installation.  
  
## Package Manager  
APT

## Installations  
### Before Starting  
When uncertain about a packet name we can use:  
> apt search name  
  
Installing files can only be done by a super user.  
We can either elevate our command temporarily by using:  
> sudo  
  
Or by elevating ourselves to super user (not recommended):  
> sudo su  
  
#### Updating  
Before installing anything we might want to update the *advanced packaging tool*:  
>sudo apt-get update  
  
Our packages:  
>sudo apt-get upgrade -y  
  
Our OS:  
>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
