# Unix
Unix was an operating system developed at Bell Labs in the mid 1960's. Many of the innovations and design choices the original Unix team have made, lived on 50+ years later, including the idea of multi-user operating systems and hierarchical file systems.

Unix is the 'grandfather' of many modern operating systems that we frequently use today.
