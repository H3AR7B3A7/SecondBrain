# GNU
Richard Stallman was a leader in the group of developers who aimed to create Free Software alternatives to Unix.

In 1984 he began work on the GNU project, with the goal of creating an operating system that included "everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system so that one could get along without any software that is not Free".
