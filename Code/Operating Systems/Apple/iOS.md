# iOS
iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system from Apple Inc. Originally developed for the iPhone, it has since been extended to support other [[Apple]] devices including the original Apple TV, iPod touch and iPad. Apple does not license iOS for installation on third-party hardware. iOS was developed from Mac OS X and has since been spun off into iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
Apple's App Store contains more than 650,000 iOS applications, which have collectively been downloaded more than 18 billion times. In May 2010, it accounted for 59% of mobile web data consumption in the United States (including use on the iPod touch and the iPad). By the last quarter of 2010, it had a 26% share of the smartphone operating system units sold, behind both Google's Android and Nokia's Symbian.
