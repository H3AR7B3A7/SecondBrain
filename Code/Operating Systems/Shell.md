# Shell
The shell is a computer interface to an operating system. Shells expose the [[Operating System]]'s services to humanusers or other programs. The shell takes our commands and gives them to the operating system to perform. It's named a shell because it is the outer layer around the OS, like the shell around an oyster.

Some popular shells are:
- Bash (Bourne-Again-SHell)
- ZSH (Z-shell)
- Fish
- ...
