# Hosting

## Domain

The web address where the customer can find the website. Usually .be or .com for 'professional-looking' websites.

### .be

Combell: €9.99 / jaar
one.com: 24.99 / jaar
easyhost: €23.99 / jaar
vimexx: €3.99 / jaar

### .com

Combell: €9.99 / jaar
one.com: €23.99 / jaar
easyhost: €23.99 / jaar
vimexx: €7.99 / jaar

_Some providers might offer cheaper initial costs and raise them later._

## Hosting

The providers of the servers where your website is ran. Taking into account the website only has to be close to 1 country and does not need replication in other locations/countries.

Netlify: 19$ / maand
Vimexx: €4.49 / maand
Combell: €5.99 / maand
Cloud86: €3.45 / maand
junda: €2 / maand

_Possibly your current internet provider is already giving you a small space that you could host a website on. However, this is usually a very small space. (+-512mb)_ 

_Hosting plans can wildly differ and should fit your requirements. Some even offer free hosting for simple static websites._

## Design

What the website should look like. This entails the styling and placeholders for the information on the site. There are thousands of existing templates that don't cost anything. But a custom design takes quite a bit of effort. But we can use cheap labor from online marketplaces or a student.

Existing templates: €0

Fiverr/...: €500 - ...

Student: €500 (can include production sometimes depending on the student)

Professional: €3000 - ... 

## Production

Actually creating the website, matching the information to the design.

Student: €500
Professional: €3000

_When done by a student, it might be crucial to ask or check for things like Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This will ensure that you are ranked highly in some aspects that are considered by search engines to show your website at the top of the search results for instance on Google._

## Maintenance

Having someone update the information on the website for you, like pricing and pictures. So not the design of the website.

Self maintenance: €0
Small and infrequent: +-€50 / month

_If users have complex sites or features (like **e-commerce** or **membership systems**), maintenance can sometimes be higher due to the need for regular security updates, backups, or database optimizations. But this is usually not needed for a simple online presence.

## Conclusion

These are the average low bounds of prices that are to be expected depending on the seniority of the people working on it. These prices can go up to infinity depending on the seniority of the developers, contingency prospects of the company (established players you can depend on), expected features, etc...

Minimum: +-€500, and +-€82 / year (with maintenance: +-€682 / year)
Minimum with custom design: +-€1000, and +-€82 / year (with maintenance: +-€682 / year)
Professional: €3000, and +-€82 / year (with maintenance: +-€682 / year)
Professional with custom design: €6000, and +-€82 / year (with maintenance: +-€682 / year)


_Personally I know a professional (with solid security and SEO knowledge) that will probably do it for €7000. But he is currently on vacation, so I'll have to ask him when he gets back if there is an interest._
